## Instruction on Using smNet software (Pytorch)
**The code has been developed and tested on the following system and packages:**\
Ubuntu16.04LTS, Python3.6.9, Pytorch0.4.0, CUDA10.1, MatlabR2015a

### 1. Setup
Copy 'loss.py' and '__init__.py' from 'setup/' to '.../nn/modules/', which is usually under following directory:
```
/home/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/
```
### 2. Training
Run the following command in a terminal:
```
python main.py --datapath '/SampleData directory/SampleData/train/' --save 'result directory' --imHeight 32 --imWidth 32
--batchsize 20 --datasize 10000 --mode z --crange 8 --foldernum 1 --weighting 1
```
**Note:**
1. Each iteration will save a model named by the iteration number.
2. The user could open errorplot.png from the result directory to observe the evolution of training
and validation errors.
3. imHeight, imWidth, datasize, mode and save are user adjustable variables. Mode here includes xy, z, aberration, alpha and beta. See opts.py for the
definitions of other user adjustable variables.
4. The user adjustable variables for training will be saved in /result directory/opt.txt
5. The training and validation errors for each iteration will be saved in /result directory/error.log (The 1st column is training error and the 2nd column is validation error)

### 3. Testing
Run the following commands line by line in a terminal:
```
python test.py --datapath '/SampleData directory/SampleData/test' --save 'result directory'  --checkpoint 100 --mode z
```
**Note:**
1. Result directory is the same for both training and testing
2. The ‘checkpoint’ is the iteration number at the stop criterion from the training step. See **Supplementary Note 4.1** in smNet Manuscript (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0153-5#Sec13)

## Instruction on Using smNet software (torch)
**The code has been developed and tested on the following system and packages:**\
Ubuntu16.04, Torch7, CUDA8.0, cuDNN-8.0, NCCL1, MatlabR2015a, mattorch1.0-0\
(Detailed package installation instructions are provided in the following text)

### 1. Training
Run the following command in a terminal:
```
th main.lua --datapath 'SampleData directory/SampleData/train/' --imHeight 32 --imWidth 32 --datasize
10000 --mode z --save ‘result directory’
```
**Note:**
1. Each iteration will save a model named by the iteration number.
2. The user could open error.log.eps from the result directory to observe the evolution of training
and validation errors.
3. imHeight, imWidth, datasize, mode and save are user adjustable variables. See opts.lua for the
definitions of other user adjustable variables.

### 2. Testing
Run the following commands line by line in a terminal:
```
cd test
th test.lua --testdatapath 'SampleData directory/SampleData/test/' --imHeight 32 --imWidth 32 --
numSubregion 410 --mode z --save ‘result directory’ --modelNum 200 --batchSize 200
```
**Note:**
1. Result directory is the same for both training and testing
2. The ‘modelNum’ is the iteration number at the stop criterion from the training step. See **Supplementary Note 4.1** in smNet Manuscript (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0153-5#Sec13)
3. Increasing batch size (‘batchSize’) during testing increases speed of forward propagation.

## Instruction on Using PSF toolbox
**The code has been tested in following system and packages:**\
Windows7, Windows10, MatlabR2015a, DIPimage(http://www.diplib.org/)

1. Change current folder in Matlab to PSF toolbox.
2. Run each example code in PSF toolbox/examples/.\
**Note: ** for PR_example.m, it requires user to select the center of the PSF in the pop up window.
3. Type ‘help classname’ in Matlab command window for detailed help on each Matlab class.
